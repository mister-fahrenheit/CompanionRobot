Edit the Main Branch and you are disowned.
Instead:
1. Make a new branch
   - Use your initials then a description Example: la/animations
2. Checkout to that branch
3. Write your code there
4. When you are done and everything works with no conflicts (remember to rebase), submit a PR.
5. Wait for me to accept your PR.
